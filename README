Recording flow
------------------------------------------------
* Register a handler for the SIGINT (Ctrl + C) signal
* Create a pipeline that reads from an RTSP url and writes
to a file
* Configure the file name
* Attach timeout callback on the main loop that
is called every 10 seconds
* Start playing the pipeline
* If SIGINT is received, terminate the main loop and clean
everything up, thus exiting the program

Every 10 seconds, a function is called, we then follow
the following flow to create a new chunk:

* Block all data flow right up until the muxer by
adding a pad probe
* Probe callback is called for every frame, pass all frames
down the pipeline until we encounter a key frame
* Send EOS to the muxer, keep the blocking probe alive
and don't allow any frames through
* When EOS is recieved by the muxer, set the muxer and filesink
to the NULL state
* Set the `location` property of the filesink to a new file
* Put the muxer and filesink elements back into playing
* Remove the blocking pad probe
* Data flow resumes and the key frame is the first frame
in the new file
